 * This view helper renders a table with a grid of inputs to allow editing with
 * a RowCollectionEditor object.  The user can dynamically add and remove rows
 * from the table.  If you have a large number of fields, this may not be a
 * workable UI for you because you'll be cramming too many columns into the table.
 *
 * The way this view helper works, all data handling is managed by the primary
 * form submission back to the server rather than via AJAX.  This ensures that
 * deletions and changes are not persisted unless the user actually submits
 * the form and avoids having to render any of the inputs in JavaScript, instead
 * re-using the EditControl rendering you've implemented already.

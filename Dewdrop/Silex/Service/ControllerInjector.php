/**
 * This class provides the ability to declare Silex controller dependencies by class name, where the dependencies are
 * automatically injected into the controller.
 *
 * It gives smart IDE's the ability to provide autocomplete support for such dependencies within controller functions,
 * without requiring the developer to provide type hint docblocks or to reference such services by array syntax with
 * hard-coded keys.
 *
 * By default, classes are instantiated with no constructor arguments and require no configuration.
 *
 * If a service needs a factory to instantiate it, provide the service class name as the key, and the Silex application
 * key where the factory function exists as the value. For example, consider the following:
 *
 * <pre>
 * // Register the service
 * $silex->register(new ControllerInjector([
 *     'My\Service' => 'my-service',
 * ]));
 *
 * // Make a route for a simple dependency that can be instantiated with no constructor arguments
 * $silex->get('/run-something', function (Something $something) {
 *     return $something->report();
 * });
 *
 * // Define a shared instance of My\Service, which requires some configuration during instantiation
 * $silex['my-service'] = $silex->share(function () {
 *     return new \My\Service(new SomeDependency());
 * });
 *
 * // Make a route that declares My\Service as a dependency
 * $silex->get('/run-my-service', function (\My\Service $myService) {
 *     return $myService->run();
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * When the browser is directed to /run-something, this service automatically instantiates a new Something object and
 * makes it available to the controller closure, so that the result of its report() method is returned.
 *
 * When the browser is directed to /run-my-service, this service automatically fetches the My\Service object from the
 * application container and passes it to the controller closure, so that the result of its run() method is returned.

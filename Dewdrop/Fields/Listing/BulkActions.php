/**
 * The BulkActions class allows you to attach any number of actions to a
 * Listing.  The user (typically with some checkboxes on a table or tile
 * view) will select one or more items and then choose an action.
 *
 * The BulkActions class will then determine which action was selected
 * (using the shouldProcess() method on each action object) and pass the
 * IDs of the selected items to that action's process() method.  The values
 * in the array of IDs will be based upon whatever primary key field is
 * set in the Listing object.
 *
 * Note that there are two different ways BulkActions might select items:
 *
 * 1) An array of IDs explicitly checked by the user.
 *
 * 2) Retrieving a non-paginated, complete dataset from the Listing and
 *    using _all_ IDs.  This is done to allow users to select all items,
 *    even those not on the currently visible page.
 *
 * If you're using multiple listings and multiple BulkActions objects on
 * a single page, you'll want to adjust the $id of each BulkActions object
 * so they don't collide.
